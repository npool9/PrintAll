# PrintAll

"Mass print" all files within a directory and its subdirectories with just a few clicks. Great for large, organized file systems that need to printed for all at once for reports, projects, etc. Very simple to use and queues all print jobs in just a few seconds as opposed to the many tedious minutes it may take to do so by hand.
